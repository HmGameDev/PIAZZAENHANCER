Hello!

Firstly, this add-on is available in the firefox extensions store for a price of 0 dollars!!!!!

However,if you wanna use this chrome extension you either can donate 5 bucks to my apple pay or launch it on your own, for free!!

the steps for installing and launching on your own are:

MAKE A FOLDER NAMED " PIAZZA ENHANCER"

then put these files into the folder.

finally, goto " chrome://extensions/ " 
( you can copy and paste it into your search bar)

Make sure youre on developer mode to upload personal extensions

finally press " load unpacked" and then select the folder


To use the extenstion click on extensions and then click the logo of this extension to access the configuration menu
